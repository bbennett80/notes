[ ] Genetics:
    - Something like DOCASSEMBLE for TRF, LMN, and PhL.
    - Could use:
        - [streamlit](streamlit.io)
        - [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
        - [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    - TRF probably not necessary?
    - Needs to be easy.
    - Add database???

Just need a way to add existing notes to word doc based on testing criteria. (Check notes at work.)
Maybe combine with weekly screening?
